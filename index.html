  <h1>The End.</h1>
  <h2>Thank you everyone for being part of the journey...</h2>

  <p>
    After months of development for Spirit SMP, a small SMP that I considered as my family, I've decided to quit. There was some drama, most likely caused by me, that led to my retirement, and now the project is dead.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, the server evolved, my roles graduated, i got promoted, and I ended up as being an owner of Spirit SMP. I led the project during the main owner's break and it was a really fun thing to do.
  </p>

  <p>
    If I write this right now, it means I apologize for retiring and I'll write this to express what I feel right now. I am sad that this journey ended in such bad terms, I eventually found back the Discord server's url and tried to join but got kicked, and afterwards banned by the one I promoted to co-owner. I understand totally, but he didn't even leave me the time to talk sincerely with him.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm Dark, and today, I really apologize. Now, I don't talk with anyone from the staff team, and this kills me. The staff team of Spirit was like my family, truly. I wish this journey never ended, and it could've, if I didn't mess up. I was low mentally, and some problems caused me to never come back to Spirit. 
  </p>

  <p>
    As of 1st of August 2025, the day I wrote this... Emma hasn't talked to me since then, I've talked with Mithoo - the one who banned me - which just told me as simple words as "Good Riddance" when I tried to come apologize, and, Lucio, the one who approved my idea to write an article in this page, has blocked me and I don't know why. I feel really bad and I wish I could fix my errors, but how?
  </p>

  <p>
    I wish y'all a good continuation, and I wrote this to express my feelings. I actually always struggled to express them really so if some things don't make sense, well, sorry, it's my fault. Goodbye! Love for the ones I hurt, Dark.
  </p>
